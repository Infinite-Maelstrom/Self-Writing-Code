1. The program semi-randomly generates a list of charachters using it's neural network to make better choices
2. The program test runs the code, and records what goes wrong.
3. the program tries to fix the error by:
  * first: see if  it a simple error and easy to fix
  * second: search the web for answers to this problem, and use them
    * possibly also ask questions on stack exchange
  * third: randomly change the code and retry.
4. the program stores all the data collected from successful code and insuccessful code and uses it to build a neural network.
5. Repeat until a condition is reached.

First stage of code is just to randomly make some characters appear in a file.
It should be vaugely code-like
Next step is to have code that checks this code and records what went wrong and where.
Next step is to have code that fixes the file of generated code - according to the three stages.
Finally, implement the neural network.
